## 2024-05-28 - [Overly Permissive CORS]
**Vulnerability:** The FastAPI application used a wildcard `"*"` for the `allow_origins` configuration in `CORSMiddleware`, allowing requests from any domain.
**Learning:** CORS was misconfigured with a wildcard in `main.py`, exposing the API to potential cross-origin attacks from malicious sites.
**Prevention:** Load a strict list of allowed origins via environment variables (e.g., `os.getenv("ALLOWED_ORIGINS")`) and default it to safe local development origins if not provided.

## Daily Process Notes
* Always run `python3 -m py_compile [filename]` or `ruff check [filename]` as quick checks.

## 2024-05-29 - [Information Exposure via Error Messages]
**Vulnerability:** The FastAPI application was catching generic exceptions (`except Exception as e:`) and directly returning the raw exception string (`str(e)`) or details like file paths directly to the client via HTTP 500 responses.
**Learning:** Returning raw exception details (`str(e)`) leaks sensitive internal server information, such as database schema details, file system paths, or downstream service URLs. This can be used by an attacker to map out the system architecture and identify further vulnerabilities.
**Prevention:** Catch exceptions and log the detailed error with stack traces on the server side using the `logging` module (`logger.error("Message", exc_info=e)`). Then, return a generic, safe error message (e.g., "Internal server error") to the client.

## 2024-05-30 - [Path Traversal in PDF Download]
**Vulnerability:** The FastAPI application directly appended user-controlled input (`storage_path` from the database) to a base directory path (`PDF_BASE_DIR`) without proper validation (`PDF_BASE_DIR / storage_path`), allowing path traversal (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`).
**Learning:** Even when path components come from a database rather than direct HTTP input, they should be treated as untrusted and validated to prevent unauthorized file system access. Using `pathlib.Path` concatenation (`/`) alone does not resolve or sanitize `../` sequences.
**Prevention:** Always validate constructed paths before using them. Resolve both the base directory and the fully constructed path using `pathlib.Path.resolve()`, and then verify that the resolved path is a subpath of the base directory using `resolved_path.is_relative_to(base_dir.resolve())`.

## 2024-05-31 - [Path Traversal in Path-Based Storage Providers]
**Vulnerability:** The application handled paths for path-based storage providers (local, google_drive, onedrive) by just appending user input `storage_path` to the root path without stripping leading slashes or verifying the resolved path was within the base directory in `resolve_storage_path`.
**Learning:** `pathlib` operator `/` acts differently if the right hand side starts with a slash `/`. It acts as an absolute root and ignores the left side entirely. Thus, `Path("/tmp/data") / "/etc/passwd"` evaluates to `/etc/passwd`.
**Prevention:** Strip leading slashes using `.lstrip("/")` before appending paths with `pathlib`, and then always verify `is_relative_to` the resolved root base directory.
